INTRODUCTION: 
Our project aim was to create a library management system which provides
some functionalities to the user and also to come up with a clean user 
interface for the same

TOOLS/LIBRARIES USED:
The user will need to have the following libraries installed:
1. Tkinter
2. Python Imaging Library (also known as PIL or pillow)
The user will also need to have the MySQL server installed in their system

PROJECT FILES:
Given are the project files 
1. main.py
2. AddBook.py
3. ViewBooks.py
4. DeleteBooks.py
5. IssueBook.py
6. ReturnBook.py

SUMMARY:

So we have successfully designed a Library Management System using python and 
tkinter. We have created multiple files in order to modularise the project and
to help it being easier to understand.

FUTURE SCOPE:

We can take this project a step further by making a tab which helps keep track 
of the previous books being issued. Likewise, we can also keep track of the date 
the books have been issued and check whether the book has been returned on time
or not. Also, we can integrate a login system which can help to authenticate a
user before they can login.
